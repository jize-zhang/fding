## Description
Current trend in building design worldwide has been to build increasingly taller, elegant and complex structures. These buildings face many challenges due to their height and performance-oriented design objectives. These slender structures can be vulnerable to natural and human-made hazards. Specifically, they are highly sensitive to wind-induced motion. 
The external envelope of a civil structure plays a particularly important role in determining the entity of its wind-induced loads. Therefore, a creative tailoring of the external geometry can benefit in the reduction of dynamic wind loads on the structure and structural motions, leading to many economic advantages as reflected in Burj Khalifa and Taipei 101.
Shape tailoring consists of modifying the external form of the building such as changing cross-sectional shapes, twisting or tapering, etc. The conventional design practice that exists in the iterative selection of limited building profiles through wind tunnel tests, represents at present the only real option available for aerodynamic shape tailoring.

With the advances in high-performance computing (HPC), computer-aided design optimization has emerged as a powerful design methodology. To achieve an automated shape tailoring of tall buildings, CFD has been taken full advantage of to evaluate the aerodynamic loads on buildings with a variety of geometric profiles, which allows the comprehensive investigation on how changes in the external shape of a building can benefit its aerodynamic performance and discovery of the optimal configuration guided by rigorous optimization algorithms. To alleviate the computational burden induced by the massive CFD simulations, surrogate models are introduced as a computationally inexpensive emulator which are calibrated based on the limited runs of CFD simulations.
