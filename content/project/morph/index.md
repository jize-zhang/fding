## Description
To venture beyond static shape optimization, the study of dynamic autonomous morphing which will permit a building to intelligently morph its profile to curb the source of dynamic wind loads is being carried out in my current research. Inspired by the biomechanics of birds that can manage to morph their profile in flight to enhance aerial locomotion under changing ambient conditions, the future tall buildings equipped with sensors and innovative actuation could potentially mimic in-flight changes birds undertake to adapt their profile substantially to enhance the aerodynamic performance in a complex wind environment. Using multiple distributed sensors would help create a sensible skin that could detect wind speed, surface pressures and building response to guide morphing. Actuators akin to muscles would allow buildings to position their profiles into the desired cross-sectional shape, e.g., a twisted form or corner modifications. Innovative actuating systems can utilize origami concept to achieve deployment through the controlled folds, tensegrity structures to adjust the shape by changing their self-stress as well as intelligent digital materials attached to the building façade to facilitate a smooth and flexible morphing surface.

Advances in high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning techniques would enable to build a data-driven design platform to glean beneficial effects of aerodynamically efficient shapes through geometric changes. This intelligent sensing, computations, control and actuation platform will serve as the “central nervous system” of the building. It will process the information collected from sensors and generate commands to activate building “muscles” in order to mitigate wind effects. To meet challenges of computational efficiency needed to inform processing in real-time, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being employed to manage autonomous morphing using database built from wind tunnel experiments, computational simulations and crowd sourcing of a wide range of building forms. Through reinforcement learning, self-diagnosis is conducted to learn from the memory base assembled from the performance data of the building itself under different wind conditions. The model predictive control (MPC) would facilitate high-performance feedback-based control for autonomous changes in building form.

This piece of research work has the promise of revolutionizing conventional tall buildings from static to dynamic façades by taking advantages of computational digital revolution that is impacting our daily lives. It will also be an integral part towards building more intelligent and resilient cities for the future. Therefore, smart buildings with autonomously morphing façades will provide robust and sustainable urban developments that are aesthetically appealing and aerodynamically efficient. These buildings will perform more robustly to conventional wind environment and to situations that are experienced infrequently, thus lessening the impact of climate anomalies and their extremes.
