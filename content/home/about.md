# Biography

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering & Earth Sciences at the University of Notre Dame under the supervision of Prof. Ahsan Kareem. I earned my degree of Master’s of Philosophy (MPhil) in Civil Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the Bachelor’s degree at Zhejiang University, China. 

My research interest lies in the area of morphing structural profiles to urban wind environment. I am focusing on the development of a computational design platform for automated form design of buildings with the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and surrogate modeling. Besides, I am conducting my research in the fields of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in CFD and autonomous morphing of tall buildings for futuristic building design with the knowledge fusion of sensing, computing and data analytics to better cope with the climate anomalies. I have published several journal and conference papers in related fields. 

In my spare time, I enjoys playing viola, traveling, and reading.
