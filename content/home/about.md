# Biography

I am currently a PhD candidate at the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering & Earth Sciences at the University of Notre Dame under the supervision of Prof. Ahsan Kareem. I received my degree of Master of Philosophy in Civil Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and a Bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University, China. 

My research interest lies in the area of autonomously morphing structural profiles to urban wind environment. I am focusing on developing a cyber-physical sensing control and actuation system for design of dynamic building facades with the knowledge fusion of sensing, computing and data analytics. As it is well known that advances in Artificial Intelligence have achieved many successes in autonomous driving, this paradigm is promising to be applied for design of the autonomously morphing structures. It will permit a building to intelligently morph its profile in real-time to curb the source of dynamic wind. I was awarded O. H. Ammann Research Fellowship and Thornton Tomasetti Foundation Student Innovation Fellowship to fund this study. I was selected to present in the National Academy of Engineering’s Global Grand Challenges Summit and MIT Rising Stars Workshop. This work also received the Best Student Paper Award at the 15th International Conference on Wind Engineering in Beijing. I am also carrying out research in the fields of uncertainty quantification (UQ) using data assimilation approaches and high-performance computing (HPC) in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
